Kubernetes:(k8s)

it is an open source container orchestration that automates

deployment
scaling
load balancing
manage containerized applications


Cluster:-

group of servers that work together to run an containerized application

MasterNode: managing scheduling,scaling,monitoring
WorkerNode: each nodes run containers inside the POD


To see the cluster data----all the cluster info will be available under .kube directory.inside the .kube directory will have config file.

Deploy the App
the deployment task is given to master node
master node will assign the task to worker nodes 
the master node will manages the worker nodes is called cluster

Kubernetes cluster (k8s) can be set into 
1)self managed kubernetes cluster
2)managed kubernetes cluster

How can we create a cluster 
1)CLI
2)aws console
3)Terraform

Kubernetes architecture
====================================================================================================
important component is master node/control plane

Master node

1)API Server ---Receives all requests
2)Scheduller --- Component that decides where a Pod should run
3)Controller manager - componenet that maintain desired state
4)etcd -- kubernetes database

using 'kubectl' we can communicate with the Control Plane

Worker node

kubelet   --- worker node agent
kube-proxy  - provide the network for communicate with control plane and worker nodes

1)Pods:-

in every k8s,containers will be created inside the pods
pods always runs inside the worker nodes
multiple pods will be created in a single node
every pod will have unique ip address
when ever a pod dies,a new ip address is created

Creation of Pods (or) resources
1)Declarative - manifest yaml files 
2)Imperative -  command execution
